# Plugin_Name: Bartleby
# syntax/fountain.vim: highlighting for Fountain screenplays. Fountain has
# structure that Markdown lacks: scene headings, character cues, dialogue
# without quotes, and transitions. ftdetect/fountain.vim gives these
# files their own filetype.
#
# Cue and dialogue detection and the rule order follow the vim-fountain
# plugin by Carson Fire. A cue line is \L*, no lowercase letter, which is
# simpler and more robust than a list of characters. When rules match at
# the same position, the one defined last wins, so scene headings and
# transitions, which are also lines in capitals, are defined after the
# dialogue region instead of being excluded from its pattern.
#
# No s:is_loaded guard: a syntax file runs once for every buffer.
